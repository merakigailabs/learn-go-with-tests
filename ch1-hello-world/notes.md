# Chapter 1 - Hello World

## Notes

When you write a program in Go, you will have a main package defined with a main func inside it. Packages are ways of grouping up related Go code together.

The func keyword defines a function with a name and a body.

With import "fmt" we are importing a package which contains the Println function that we use to print.
